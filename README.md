Introduction
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is an example of how to create a simple, yet fully functional, game using Python's Tkinter library. It's a great starting point for those interested in learning more about GUI programming in Python.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: The game offers a straightforward and easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible for players of all ages.
Automatic Win Detection: The game automatically identifies when a player has won and visually highlights the winning combination.
Dynamic Turn Display: The game clearly indicates whose turn it is, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.
Setup
To get started with the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
Install Dependencies:

This project requires Python 3.x and Tkinter. Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If it's not installed, you can add it using:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # for Linux users
brew install python-tk           # for macOS users
Run the Game:

bash
Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
How to Play
The game board is a 3x3 grid where two players take turns to place their marks ("X" or "O").
Click on an empty space to place your mark.
The game will automatically check for a winner after each move.
If a player wins, the winning combination will be highlighted, and a message box will announce the winner.
The game will then close automatically.

Core Functions
check_winner():

This function checks the board after each move to see if there’s a winning combination.
It highlights the winning buttons in green and displays a victory message if a player wins.
button_click(index):

This function handles the logic for each button press. It places the current player's mark on the board and checks for a winner.
If there’s no winner yet, it switches to the next player.
toggle_player():

This function alternates the active player between "X" and "O" and updates the turn display accordingly.
GUI Layout
The GUI is composed of 9 buttons, arranged in a 3x3 grid, each representing a cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
A label below the grid indicates whose turn it is, ensuring that the gameplay is clear and organized.
Game Logic
The game alternates between two players.
A player wins by aligning three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game highlights this and then ends.
